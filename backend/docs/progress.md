# Milestone 1: local backend infrastructure

Implemented a minimal FastAPI application, validated environment settings,
PostgreSQL-only SQLAlchemy connectivity, and independent liveness/readiness.
Compose defines exactly API and PostgreSQL, localhost ports, a database health
check, and persistent project-scoped storage. Dependencies are locked in uv.lock.

Verified on 2026-10-02:
- `uv sync --locked` succeeded on Python 3.12.3.
- Ruff lint and formatting checks passed; all 9 focused tests passed.
- `docker compose config --quiet` passed.
- A real host Uvicorn process returned live 200, readiness 503 against an
  unreachable database port within 10 seconds, and live remained 200.

Blocked: `docker compose up --build -d --wait` failed with permission denied on
`/var/run/docker.sock`. Passwordless sudo is unavailable. No real PostgreSQL
success, Compose outage, or recovery checks were performed. Enable Docker access
for this WSL user, then run the README verification sequence. Unit tests are not
substitutes for these checks. pytest emits an upstream Starlette warning about
HTTPX TestClient deprecation; the requested HTTPX tests still pass.

The prior generated implementation was removed in cleanup commit c0a432f.
No business features or CI were added. Next milestone: business data models and
migrations, after completing the outstanding real PostgreSQL verification.
